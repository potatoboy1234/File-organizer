## General Information
- This script moves files into folders based on their file extension. While this is already something the OS can do out of the box, it just reorganizes the view instead of changing the file location. 

## Technologies Used
- Python


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Moves files into folders based on extension


## Setup

- Install python

## Usage

- You can see the list of supported file extensions in the file_formats.json file. 


## Project Status
Project is: complete


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Add more file foramts to support
- Change the way the files are organized, maybe based on their usage (work/personal)
- Add UI so the user can select the directory
- Allow the user to ignore certain file formats during the process
